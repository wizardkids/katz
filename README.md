# katz
a command-line archiving utility

Most GUI archiving utilities have many wonderful features that I never use and a plethora of settings that I never change. "katz" eliminates all this hassle and delivers a minimalist archiving utility that will meet the needs of 99% of users. From the command-line!

## Branches
**v1.0** -- this is the first, fully functional version of "katz" and is located in the branch "v1.0"

**dev** -- v2.0, under development; at any point in time, probably contains bugs, but mostly works fine

## Future plans
- v2.0 -- create an interface that works like a standard Windows command window that will have a familiar "feel" for users

- v3.0 -- add support for other archiving formats, including tar and gzip

- v4.0 -- add support for importing into other scripts so that, for example, downloaded archives are extracted automatically
